    <p>
        My name is Tristan Owen, I hope to graduate from the <strong>Wake Early College of Information and Biotechnologies</strong>. 
        I want to stay an additional 13th year afterward to obtain my Associates in applied science for computer programming. <br> <br>With that I aim to accquire a 
        position as a junior developer or to freelance on the side so that I may afford tuition at a four year university. In such university
        I plan to enter a dual degree program, so that i can <br>have both a major in theatre arts and computer science. <br> <br>The reason I want 
        both degrees is because I have a deep passion for theatre and acting as well as an interest in video games and computer programming.
        <br> I hope in future that I can act/be involved in theatre and work in the computer programming field to financially support myself.
        <br>
