    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Theatre</strong></li>
        <p>
            Since middle school I have loved partaking in the making and execution of plays. I have been acting and generally helping 
            in the making of plays for years as a hobby.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Video Games</strong></li>
        <p>
            For years I have played video games to pass the time. I mostly play rogue likes such as Balatro and Hades but I 
            have also played classics like Sonic Adventures 2 and shooters like Call of Duty and Halo
        </p>
        <li><strong>Reading</strong></li>
        <p>
            I have always loved reading books, the stories and characters have always been very entertaining and immersive. I mostly
            read fantasy, dystopian, and horror novels for these reasons.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Animals</strong></li>
        <p>
            I have always loved animals, in fact I have 8 dogs and 5 cats. I also work at a petting zoo where I take care of and frequently
            interact with cows, donkeys, goats, chickens, rabbits, and horses. 
        </p>
        <li><strong>Music Listening</strong></li>
        <p>
            I listen to music very often, I mostly listen to rock genres such as post-hardcore, pop-punk, heavy metal, emo, and screamo.
            However, I also listen to small amounts of hip-hop and pop music.
